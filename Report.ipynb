    "# Introduction\n",
    "During the COVID-19 pandemic, traffic all around the world decreased and roads were nearly empty. After the pandemic, a lot of companies in the Netherlands allowed their employees to work from home (fully or partially). It would be expected that this has an influence on the traffic patterns. In the Netherlands Tuesdays and Thursdays are by far the busiest days for commuting trips (ANWB, 2023). This has been the same before the pandemic when most people went to the office five days a week, but interestingly ANWB stated that in 2023 the heaviness of traffic jams (the length times the duration) increased with 17% compared to earlier years. They say that the effect of remote working cannot be seen in the data regarding traffic jams (ANWB, 2023). In 2023, compared to 2019 there were 470.000 more cars on the roads which has impact on the traffic jams (NOS, 2023a), and a research from Kantar Public (NOS, 2023b) showed that there were more car movements on each day in 2023 compared to 2019. \n",

    "# Methods\n",
    "\n"
    "The data used is from five sources. The first and by far the largest data set is a list of every time there was traffic congestion on Dutch motorways, in the years 2018, 2019, 2022, and 2023 and across all 12 months in each year. This dataset also contains information about the specific date and time of the traffic, the cause of the traffic, its location, and others. The second data set contains the average distance travelled per trip divided in a number of ways, including by whether the trip was a commute to work and the distance of the trip. The third dataset is the average distance travelled per trip divided by demographic information, such as by gender, education level, employment status, whether one possesses a driver's license, and more. The fourth dataset gives the proportion of people who are working from home in various EU countries, including the Netherlands. Finally, the last dataset gives the number of trips per day by mode and by year, including subsets that are just commuting, shopping, and other trips. \n"

    "The first data set was the most complex to use. It is in Dutch, so it needed to be translated and was far too large to translate manually. It also contains data that was deemed irrelevant, such as traffic jams which were had causes other than congestion. This dataaset was initially processed by translating it to English and removing traffic jams which were not caused by peak hour congestion, as these are not related to commuting. The data set remained very large and the information unwieldy, so it then needed to be processed further. Two values were examined in the analysis. The first was a simple count of the number of traffic jams, divided by month and day of the week. For example, the count for all Mondays in a month is added up, along with each other day of the week. The database also contains a value called "heaviness," which upon closer inspection is simply the average length of the traffic jam multiplied by its duration and divided by 10^7. This heaviness value was deemed important because it allows a degree of understanding of the severity of each traffic jam. A traffic jam involving 15 cars has a much lower impact and is much less important than one involving 1000 cars, and the length and duration of the traffic jam allows for some understanding of each jam's severity relative to another. Thus, the heaviness was summed in a way similar to how the raw number of jams. \n"

    "The second and third data sets were combined into one. Irrelevant columns, such as regional data, were removed from the dataset. The resulting dataset contains the number of trips per person per day, the distance per person per day, and the average number of car trips per person per day. \n"

    "With all the data in a correct form, it was then processed to generate insights and graphs. \n"

    "# Results analysis and interpretation\n",
    "\n",
    "The analysis of average commuting per person per weekday, presents a declining trend in total commuting trips from 2018 to 2019, with a more pronounced reduction—approximately 20% on average - over the last two years. This decline is not associated with unemployment rates, as the unemployment rates in 2018 and 2019 (4.87% and 4.45%) were actually higher than in 2022 and 2023 (3.52% and 3.55%) in the Netherlands, according to CBS StatLine. This suggests that the rise in remote work post-pandemic has significantly reduced commuting trips, as many employees no longer need to go to work everyday.\n",
    "In addition, during the last two years, most commuting trips were done on Tuesdays, followed by Thursdays, Mondays, Wednesdays, and Fridays. This pattern diverges from 2018 and 2019, when Mondays were as significant as or more than Thursdays. This shift reflects the current situation among hybrid-schedules works, who typically do not travel to the office on Mondays and Fridays.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "The same patterns / different patterns are observed in traffic jams data….\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "However, average commuting trips increased by 4% in 2023 compared to 2022, suggesting that companies may be gradually encouraging employees to work on-office more frequently.\n"
